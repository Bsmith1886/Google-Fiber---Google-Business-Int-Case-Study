# Google-Fiber---Google-Business-Int-Case-Study

This is the project I completed as part of the Google Business Intelligence Certificate.

## Case Study Overview

The Google Fiber customer service teamâ€™s goal is to determine how often customers are calling customer support after their first inquiry. This analysis will help leadership understand how effectively the team is answering customer questions on the first attempt. The dashboard you create should demonstrate an understanding of this goal and provide stakeholders with insights about repeat caller volumes in different markets and the types of problems they represent. 

As part of the interview process, you have been asked to create a dashboard that will:

* Help them understand how often customers are calling customer support after their first inquiry. This will assist leadership in assessing how effectively the team resolves customer questions on the first attempt.
* Provide insights into the types of customer issues that seem to generate more repeat calls.
* Explore repeat caller trends in the three different market cities.
* Design charts so that stakeholders can view trends by week, month, and year.

## Data

The data was provided in the form of three CSV files. All three files had an identical format, so no cleaning was necessary before loading them into Tableau.

The files contained information about the number of initial contacts to the company's customer service team, as well as the number of repeat contacts over a seven-day period following the first contact. A repeat contact is defined as any customer who called the customer service team more than once within a seven-day period after their initial contact. The data was structured as follows:


<img width="479" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eac4cefa-8357-420b-8904-d08f16770058" />



* date Created = Date of first contact
* contacts_n = total Intital contacts on Date Created
* contacts_n_1 = Total contacts that called a second time 1 day after their initial contact
* contacts_n_2 = Total contacts that called a second time 2 days after their initial contact
* contacts_n_3 = Total contacts that called a second time 3 daya after their initial contact
* contacts_n_4 = Total contacts that called a second time 4 days after their initial contact
* contacts_n_5 = Total contacts that called a second time 5 days after their initial contact
* contacts_n_6 = Total contacts that called a second time 6 days after their initial contact
* contacts_n_7 = Total contacts that called a second time 7 days after their initial contact
* new_type = Coded column for Problem Type
* new_market = Coded column for Market


The problem type definitions were provided seperately by the management team. I used those definitions to create a helper table that I added to tableau as a supplement. This table was structered as follows:


<img width="168" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d10882bc-2a8c-4118-8477-666eb93b709d" />


* new_type = Primary key from data table
* problem_type = problem types provided by management team

### Data Preparation

All tables were loaded into Tableau. The three CSV files containing data about call volumes were unioned within Tableau. The supplemental table with the problem types was also loaded into Tableau, and a table relationship was created using the `new_type` columns from each dataset.

Three new calculated columns were created to address the business questions:

* **Total Contacts**: Aggregation of `contacts_n`. This value represents the total initial contacts to customer service.
* **Total Repeat Contacts**: Aggregation of `contacts_n_1`, `contacts_n_2`, `contacts_n_3`, `contacts_n_4`, `contacts_n_5`, `contacts_n_6`, and `contacts_n_7`. This value represents the total volume of repeat callers.
* **Rate of Repeat Contacts**: `Total Repeat Contacts` divided by `Total Contacts`. This represents the percentage of callers who called more than once over a seven-day period.


## Visualizations

The following dashboard was created within Tableau to give the Management Team the abiility to slice the data within each market and by problem type.

## Analysis

### Market 1

Market 1 is by far largets in terms of overall call volume:

<img width="598" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f2db709-c61b-4335-9ca2-8f069fcac6e1" />


Market 1 has high rates of repeat callers in 3 categories:
* Account Management
* Internet and Wifi
* Technician Troubleshooting

### Market 2

Market 2 has by far the lowest overall rate of repeat callers, but still a fairly high rate of repeat calls for Account Management

### Market 3

Market 3 has a the highest rate of repeat callers, although markets 1 and 3 are both quite high.

<img width="513" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ec2417c-ba1f-4fbc-b85d-f6edc5fe77ab" />

Market 3 has a high rate of repeat callers in 3 categories:
* Account Management
* Internet and Wifi
* Scheduling

## Recommendations

### Next Steps

* Investigate the reasons for additional calls related to Account Management in all three markets.
* Determine why the number of repeat calls is higher than first contacts in Market 3 for Account Management issues (this could indicate a data integrity issue).
* Investigate the reasons for repeat callers for Internet and Wi-Fi issues in Markets 1 and 3.
* Investigate the reasons for repeat callers related to Scheduling in Market 3.
* Review customer service practices in Market 2 and compare them to Markets 1 and 3 to determine why Market 2 has a significantly lower rate in all problem categories.
